This repository holds my attempts at solving the puzzles put forth by the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Every year, the site puts out a daily pair of holiday themed puzzles starting on December 1. The puzzles for each year
are always available and will track your progress. I am currently using PHP for solutions in an attempt to stay on top
of changes and trends in that community.
